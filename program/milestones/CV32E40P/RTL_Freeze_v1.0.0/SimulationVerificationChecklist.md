## Simulation Verification Checklist for Functional RTL Freeze
An item is "signed off" once the `Signed-off By` and `Sign-off Date` cells are filled in. `Signed-off By` should be an email address.  If there is an Exception or Waiver, it should be captured as a GitHub issue in core-v-verif and the issue number recorded in the `Exceptions/Waiver/Comment` cell.
